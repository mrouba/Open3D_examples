# Open3D: A Modern Library for 3D Data Processing
Open3D is an open-source library specifically crafted to streamline the development of software handling 3D data. The library's frontend exposes a carefully selected suite of data structures and algorithms, 
providing a seamless experience for developers in both C++ and Python.

This repository serves as a collection of code examples showcasing the capabilities of the Open3D library.
Whether you are a beginner looking to learn about 3D point cloud processing or an experienced user exploring Open3D's features, 
these examples can serve as educational material:

# Data

The `Data` directory holds examples of data used in the provided code scripts.

# Code

The `Code` directory includes the following Python scripts:

1. **visualize_point_cloud.py**

   This script demonstrates the basic visualization of a 3D point cloud.

2. **point_cloud_processing.py**

   The script showcases various operations for processing 3D point cloud data.

3. **icp_registration_and_visualization.py**

   This script focuses on Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration between two 3D point clouds and visualizes the results.


## Requirements

Before exploring the examples, ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Open3D
## Installation
You can install Open3D using the following command:
```bash
# Install
pip install open3d       # or
